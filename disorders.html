        <ol>
          <li>Constipation/Fecal Impaction - defined as fewer than three bowel movements per week; sacral nerve stimulation, laxatives, enema, fiber/water, exercise, surgery are treatment options</li>
           <li>Constipation can be caused by megacolon, low residue diet, dehydration, opiates, anticholinergics, antacids, hypothyroidism, diabetic neuropathy, abdominal muscle weakness</li>
           <li>Diarrhea - three or more bowel movements a day, with increased volume and weight</li>
           <li>Three types of diarrhea - osmotic (water drawn into lumen by nonabsorbable substance), secretory (excessive chloride or bicarbonate rich fluid, or inhibition of sodium absorption), and motility (excessive motility causes less fluid absorption)</li>
           <li>Clinical manifestations of diarrhea include - dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, <b>metabolic acidosis</b></li>
           <li>Treatment for diarrhea includes rehydration, medications (loperamide or atropine), fiber, fecal transplant, or probiotics in the case of <i>Clostridium difficile</i></li>
           <li>Dysphagia - difficulty swallowing - could be mechanical, functional, idiopathic</li>
           <li>Functional disorders causing dysphagia incude vagal/pharyngeal nerve damage (stroke), infectious diseases, autoimmune disorders (Sjogren's, SLE, Myasthenia Gravis, Multiple Sclerosis)</li>
           <li>Diagnosis of dysphagia - x-ray, barium swallow, manometry, fiberoptic endoscopy</li>


           <li>Oropharyngeal dysphagia - caused by brainstem stroke (nucleus ambiguous), cranial nerve or C1-3 neuropathy/compression, skeletal muscle disorders</li>
           <ul>
           <li>Symptoms include dysphagia within 2 seconds of swallowing, sticking in throat</li>
           <li>Typically irreversible</li>
           </ul>
           <li>Cricopharyngeal (UES) - UES spasm, lump in throat, Zenker diverticulum (pouch in throat)</li>
           <ul>
             <li>UES incontinence caused by swallowing of nitrogen (aerophagia) leading to flatus (or O2, CO2, H2, methane)</li>
             <li>CO2 flatus caused by soft drinks or bicarbonate, methane and sulfur from malabsorption, hypermotility, or upper GI infection</li>
             <li>Normal incidence 15+-7 times a day, with more volume for men than women</li>
           </ul>
           <li>Zenker's Diverticulum</li>
           <ul>
           <li>Just above the cricopharyngeal muscle; a pseudodiverticulum that appears in the hypopharynx or an area know as <b>Killian's triangle</b> - more common in older people, very rare</li>
           <li>Zenker's Diverticulum is a discoordination of pharyngeal and esophageal phases or UES spasm - interferes with closer of glottis and UES, treated surgically</li>
           <li>Endoscopic treatment causes shorter length of hospitalization, earlier diet introduction, lower rates of problems, but higher recurrence</li>
           </ul>
           <li>Aspiration - contents enter trachea - increased likelihood with neuropathy, age, collagen disease, etc. - CO2 levels increase</li>
           <ul>
           <li>Complications include respiratory arrest or obstruction (immediate), pulmonary edema (hours), pneumonia (days)</li>

           </ul>
           <li>Esophageal dysphagia caused by stroke, vagal neuropathy, smooth muscle myopathies, connective tissue disease</li>
           <ul>
             <li>Damage to enteric nerves or loss of ENS function can be causal, as can eosinophilia</li>
             <li>Symptoms include dysphagia > 2 sec after swallowing, sticking in chest, secondary swallowing reflex, thumping senstation in chest</li>
             <li>Evaluated with barium contrast media and typically irreversible - pain killers may help</li>
             <li>Focal dermal hypoplasia of squamous papillomas of the esophagus can cause dysphagia;
             treatment is not required but largest lesions can be used endoscopically - does not predispose to esophageal cancer</li>

           </ul>
           <li>LES hypertension - loss of inhibitory motor neurons, odynophagia, progresses to achalasia, treated with smooth muscle relaxants</li>
           <li>Diffuse esophageal spasm - dysphagia, chest pain</li>
           <li>Nutcracker esophagus (hypertensive peristalsis) - where esophageal waves > 180 mm Hg, causes dysphagia, odynophagia</li>
           <li>Achalasia - failure of LES relaxation, progression of LES tonicity, due to damage to ENS; barium swallow reveals <b>bird's beak</b> at LES -
           functional disorders treated with smooth muscle relaxants or Botox, structural disorders require dilation (pneumatic dilator)</li>
           <li>Gastro Esophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) - affects 1/3 of population - main symptom heartburn</li>
           <ul><li>Primarily LES disorder, lack of tone</li>
             <li>Spincter injury secondary to gastric ulcer or hiatial hernia</li>
             <li>Barret esophagus in 20% of GERD patients - characterized by epithelial dysplasia and can lead to esophageal cancer</li>
             <li>Stretta procedure is in middle of medication and surgery - radiofrequency energy to LES</li>
             <li>GERD can cause loss of enamel, dental decay, dry mouth - red wine may prevent tooth decay and gum disease</li>

           </ul>
           <li>Hiatal hernia - protrusion of upper part of stomach through diaphragm into thorax</li>
           <ul><li>Type I - sliding, most common - GE junction displaced above diaphragm</li>
           <li>Type II - Fundus above diaphragm</li>
           <li>Type III - GE junction and part of stomach above diaphragm</li>
           <li>Only types II and III cause necrosis, strangulation</li>
           <li>Treated with surgery or gastric anti-secretory therapy</li></ul>
           <li>Pyloric (gastric outlet) obstruction - can be congenital (infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis) from thickening of circular muscle or less longitudinal muscle</li>
           <li>Can be acquired from malignancy, infection, tumors</li>
           <li>Treated with pyloromyotomy in neonates, gastric drainage or surgery or medications (H2 antagonists) in adults</li>
           <li>Sphincter incontinence - caused by collagen diseases (most common cause of GERD), neuropathy, eosinophilia, xerostomia (lack of protective HCO3-)</li>
           <li>Gastroparesis - delayed gastric emptying - less severe pyloric obstruction; caused by excessive tone, neuropathy, less gastric compliance, bradygastria (low gastic waves)</li>
           <li>Treated with endoscopic dilation, artificial pacemaker (bradygastria)</li>
           <li>Most common adult gastric motility disorder</li>
           <li>Dumping Syndrome or Rapid Gastric Emptying</li>
           <ul>
             <li>Damage to pyloric sphincter by Helicobacter pylori, gastric bypass surgery, tachygastria</li>
             <li>Early phase symptoms - diaphoresis, vomiting</li>
             <li>Late stage symptoms - rebound hypoglycemia, malabsorptive diarrhea</li>
           </ul>
           <li>Paralytic ileus - common following abdominal surgery; presents with abdominal distension and minimal pain; bowel sounds are minimal unlike with mechanical obstructions - managed with nasogastric suction, correction of electrolyte imbalance</li>
           <li>Hirschsprung disease (congenital aganglionic megacolon) - polygenic due to improper differentiation of myenteric plexus and submucosal plexus in distal colon; absence of enteric ganglion causes failure to pass meconium at birth, treated with
           surgical resection of aganglionic megacolon</li>
           <li>Irritable Bowel Syndrome - more common in women, correlates with increased intestinal motility, mimics bowel infection</li>
           <li>Hydrogen breath test reveals mouth to cecum time - treat IBS with anti-diarrheal drugs or fiber</li>
           <li>Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) - Crohn's and Ulcerative Colitis - treated with antiinflammatory and immunosuppressing medication</li>
           <li>Crohn's disease due to excessive helper T response, TNF increases mucosal permeability, damage often deep</li>
           <li>Ulcerative colitis due to anti colonic antibodies - accumulation of CD8+ cells in lamina propria, damage restricted to mucosa and submucosa</li>
           <li>Crohn's affects any GI area and can skip area, leads to shortened villi and deep lesions</li>
           <li>UC affects colon, especially descending and sigmoid, continuous damage area and pseudopolyps</li>
           <li>Four causes of intestinal obstruction - herniation, adhesion, intussusception, volvulus</li>
           <li>Volvulus - twisting or axial rotation of bowel, relived by decompression and needs surgery to prevent iscehmia</li>
           <li>Bilious vomiting (yellow/green) is characteristic of intestinal obstruction below duodenal papilla</li>
           <li>Rectal prolapse - full thickness or internal prolapse - has full concentric rings</li>
